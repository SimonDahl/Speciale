# Speciale

All code used to create results for Master's thesis. Files in /code are as follows: 

/GAN - All different standard GAN trained on ODEs 

/NSGAN - NSGAN along wiht data, both for data-driven solution and discovery 

/PI_(NS)GAN -both for data-driven solution and discovery

/PI_GAN_attemps - All failed version of PIG/PID-GAN 

/PI_GANs - Working version of PIG/PID-GAN along wit two non-working used to create figures 

/PI_VAE - failed attemps 

/PINNs - All PINN implementations both for data-driven solution and discovery, and AD expiriment

/VAE - All different standard VAE trained on ODEs 

/WGAN_(GP) - Test of WGAN and WGAN-GP 

/diverse - Mostly Junk
